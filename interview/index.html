				<h1>Interview With University Of Toronto Student<h1>
				

		<div class="container">

		<div class="q">
		<h2>Emily: Where do you go to school and what classes are you taking?</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="a">
<p>Maeve: I go to the University of Toronto and I’m double majoring in BioPsychology and Law. Right now, I’m taking Neurogenetics, Pharmacology, Criminal Law, and an Intro to Python coding course. </p>
</div>


<div class="q">
	<h2>E: Why do you want to go into law?</h2>
</div>

<div class="a">
	<p>M: I want to go into law because I like the rationality and argument-building that’s involved. I like being able to prove my point and construct an argument that I’m confident in, and I think it’s rewarding to be able to use these skills to change someone’s mind or opinion. </p>
</div>

<div class="q">
	<h2>E: Do you feel that you have to be creative in your desired job?</h2>
</div>

<div class="a">
	<p>M: I think that there’s some degree of creativity involved, in approaching problems from unexpected angles, but I wouldn’t consider myself a super creative person, so I like the concreteness of the law as something to work with in my job. </p>
</div>

<div class="q">
	<h2>E: In what ways does design help you as a student?</h2>
</div>

<div class="a">
	<p>M: Design helps me as a student by making some of my work more engaging and interesting, like when I make my notes or a presentation that I want to be easy to read and attention-grabbing. </p>
</div>

<div class="q">
	<h2>E: When do you feel the most productive?</h2>
</div>

<div class="a">
	<p>M: I feel the most productive when I plan out my days, and have a detailed list of what I need to get done to pressure myself. Even though I’m not really a morning person, I’m the most productive when I plan to get up early and start working. Also, I find that working in a library or somewhere quiet is the most effective place for me. </p> 
</div>

<div class="q">
	<h2>E: What are some designs in society that you ardmire and why?</h2>
</div>

<div class="a">
	<p>M: Some of my favourite designs in society are things like book covers and architecture.</p> 
</div>

<div class="q">
	<h2>E: Do you benefit from feedback on your work?</h2>
</div>

<div class="a">
	<p>M: I like getting feedback on my work, especially in big classes where I don’t get much one-on-one discussion with my professors. Feedback helps me to improve on future assignments, and makes me think more critically about my own work. </p>
</div>

<div class="q">
<h2>E: Will technology benefit you in your future career?</h2>
</div>

<div class="a">
	<p>M: Technology will definitely benefit me in my future career, from things like being able to access more research tools and being able to create, edit and distribute my work.</p>
